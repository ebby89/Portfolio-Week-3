# _Epicodus - Week 3 Solo Project - Ping Pong_

#### _Generates sequential "Ping-Pong" list, 9.22.2017_

#### By _**Kyle Ebersole**_

## Description

_Takes a number input from the user and generates a range of numbers from 1 to the input number. Each response is evaluated against a set of rules that determine whether a number, 'ping', 'pong', or 'ping-pong' are displayed. This project was created to practice using arrays and looping during our third weel at Epicodus._

## Specs

| Behavior Description                                                                    | Input | Output                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| The program will count sequentially up to the provided number.                          | 3     | [1, 2, 3]                     |
| The program will determine whether or not a number is divisible by 3.                   | 4     | false                         |
| The program will determine whether or not a number is divisible by 5.                   | 5     | true                          |
| The program will determine whether or not a number is divisible by 15.                  | 45    | true                          |
| Each number that is divisible by 3, it will be replaced with the word "ping".           | 3     | [1, 2, 'ping']                |
| Each number that is divisible by 5 will be replaced with the word "pong".               | 5     | [1, 2, 'ping', 4, 'pong']     |
| Each number that is divisible by 15 will be replaced with the words "ping-pong".        | 15    | ['ping', 13, 14, 'ping-pong'] |
| Each number will only display the word associated with it's highest divisible number.   | 30    | [28, 29, 'ping-pong']         |

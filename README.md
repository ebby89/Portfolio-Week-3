# _Epicodus - Week 3 Solo Project - Ping Pong_

#### _Generates sequential "Ping-Pong" list, 9.22.2017_

#### By _**Kyle Ebersole**_

## Description

_Takes a number input from the user and generates a range of numbers from 1 to the input number. Each response is evaluated against a set of rules that determine whether a number, 'ping', 'pong', or 'ping-pong' are displayed. This project was created to practice using arrays and looping during our third week at Epicodus._

| Behavior Description                                                                         | Input   | Output                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| The program only allows numbers to be entered.                                               | abc     | 'Please enter a positive number.' |
| The program only allows positive numbers to be entered.                                      | -1      | 'Please enter a positive number.' |
| The program will create an alert pop-up for a blank input submission.                        | (empty) | 'Please enter a positive number.' |
| The program will display a sequential list of numbers from 1 up to the inputted number.      | 3       | [1, 2, 3]                         |
| The program recognizes numbers divisible by 3 and replaces them with "ping".                 | 3       | 1, 2, 'ping'                    |
| The program recognizes numbers divisible by 5 and replaces them with "pong".                 | 5       | 1, 2, 'ping', 4, 'pong'         |
| The program recognizes numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 and replaces them with "ping-pong". | 15      | ... 'ping', 13, 14, 'ping-pong' |
